  * Weisss Introductory Statistics, Ninth Edition is the ideal textbook for introductory statistics classes that emphasize statistical reasoning and critical thinking. The text is suitable for a one- or two-semester course. Comprehensive in its coverage, Weisss meticulous style offers careful, detailed explanations to ease the learning process. With more than 1,000 data sets and more than 2,600 exercises, most using real data, this text takes a data-driven approach that encourages students to apply their knowledge and develop statistical literacy.
 
  * Introductory Statistics, Ninth Edition, contains parallel presentation of critical-value andp-value approaches to hypothesis testing. This unique design allows both the flexibility to concentrate on one approach or the opportunity for greater depth in comparing the two.
